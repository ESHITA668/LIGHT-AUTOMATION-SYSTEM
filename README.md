# LIGHT-AUTOMATION-SYSTEM
c++
My project counts the no of people enter and 
exit from the room. Using two PIR sensor side by 
side I create a SINGLE DOOR COUNTER.
When a person enter in room my counter counts adds 1.
If a person exit from the room counter subtracts 1.
By doing this it can determine no of people present in room. 
I am also using LDR sensor for detecting light intensity. 
If no of people is greater than one and light intensity is below selected threshold intensity then light will beturned on. 
If people is present but light intensity above 
threshold then lights will not turned on. 
If light intensity in below selected threshold intensity but 
there is no people in the room lights will turned off
